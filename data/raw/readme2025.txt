1.1 Introduction

This database contains pitching, hitting, and fielding statistics for Major League Baseball from 1871 through 2025.  It includes data from
the two current leagues (American and National) and the following other major leagues, as recognized by SABR:

National Association (1871-1875)
American Association (1882-1891)
Union Association (1884)
Players League (1890)
Federal League (1914-1915)
Negro National League I (1920–1931)
Eastern Colored League (1923–1928)
American Negro League (1929)
East-West League (1932)
Negro Southern League (1932)
Negro National League II (1933–1948)
Negro American League (1937–1950)

In addition, Negro League barnstorming/independent teams from 1891-1936 are included in the data under pseudo-leagues labeled 
"Eastern Independent Clubs," "Independent Clubs," and "Western Independent Clubs." While these clubs were not part of established
leagues, they have been selected as major league caliber in light of the economic and social conditions that forced them to
play outside a typical league structure.

This database was created by Sean Lahman, who pioneered the effort to make baseball statistics freely available to the general public. What
started as a one-man effort in 1994 has grown tremendously, and now a team of researchers has collected their efforts to make this the
largest and most accurate source for baseball statistics available anywhere. (See Acknowledgements below for a list of the key
contributors to this project.)

None of what we have done would have been possible without the pioneering work of Hy Turkin, S.C. Thompson, David Neft, and Pete
Palmer (among others).  All baseball fans owe a debt of gratitude to the people who have worked so hard to build the tremendous set
of data that we have today.  Our thanks also to the many members of the Society for American Baseball Research who have helped us over
the years.  We strongly urge you to support and join their efforts. Please visit their website (www.sabr.org).

If you have any problems or find any errors, please let us know.  Any feedback is appreciated at lahmandb@sabr.org.

1.2 What's New 
The Seamheads Negro League data, which was added this past October, has special notes in 2.1 Notes on Negro League data.

1.3 Acknowledgements

Much of the raw data contained in this database comes from the work of Pete Palmer, the legendary statistician, who has had a hand in most 
of the baseball encyclopedias published since 1974. He is largely responsible for bringing the batting, pitching, and fielding data out
of the dark ages and into the computer era.  Without him, none of this would be possible.  For more on Pete's work, please read his own 
account at: http://sabr.org/cmsfiles/PalmerDatabaseHistory.pdf

Three people have been key contributors to the work that followed, first by taking the raw data and creating a relational database, and later 
by extending the database to make it more accessible to researchers.

Sean Lahman launched the Baseball Archive's website back before most people had heard of the World Wide Web.  Frustrated by the
lack of sports data available, he led the effort to build a baseball database that everyone could use. He created the first version
of the database and began to make it available for free download from his website in 1995.  

The work of Sean Forman to create and maintain an online encyclopedia at Baseball-Reference.com was a quantum leap for both fans and 
researchers. The website launched in 2000, providing a user-friendly interface to the Lahman Baseball Database.  Forman and Lahman launched
the Baseball Databank in 2001, a group of researchers whose goal was to update and maintain the database as an open-source collection available
to all.
  
Ted Turocy has done the lion's share of the work to update the main data tables during the 2010s, automating the work of annual updates and linking
historical data to play-by-play accounts compiled by Retrosheet.

A handful of researchers have made substantial contributions to maintain this database over the years. Listed alphabetically, they 
are: Derek Adair, Mike Crain, Kevin Johnson, Rod Nelson, Tom Tango, and Paul Wendt. These folks did much of the heavy lifting and are 
largely responsible for the improvements made since 2000.

Others who made important contributions include: Dvd Avins, Clifford Blau, Bill Burgess, Clem Comly, Jeff Burk, Randy Cox, 
Mitch Dickerman, Paul DuBois, Mike Emeigh, F.X. Flinn, Bill Hickman, Jerry Hoffman, Dan Holmes, Micke Hovmoller, Peter Kreutzer, 
Danile Levine, Bruce Macleod, Ken Matinale, Michael Mavrogiannis, Cliff Otto, Alberto Perdomo, Dave Quinn, John Rickert, Tom Ruane,
Theron Skyles, Hans Van Slooten, Michael Westbay, and Rob Wood.

Many other people have made significant contributions to the database over the years.  The contribution of Tom Ruane's effort to the overall
quality of the underlying data has been tremendous. His work at Retrosheet.org integrates the yearly data with the day-by-day data,
creating a reference source of startling depth. 

Sean Holtz helped with a major overhaul and redesign before the 2000 season. Keith Woolner was instrumental in helping turn
a huge collection of stats into a relational database in the mid-1990s. Clifford Otto & Ted Nye also helped provide guidance to the early 
versions. Lee Sinnis, John Northey & Erik Greenwood helped supply key pieces of data. Many others have written in with corrections and 
suggestions that made each subsequent version even better than what preceded it. 

The work of the SABR Baseball Records Committee, led by Lyle Spatz, has been invaluable.  So has the work of Bill Carle and the SABR 
Biographical Committee. David Vincent, keeper of the Home Run Log and other bits of hard-to-find info, was always helpful. The recent
addition of colleges to player bios is the result of much research by members of SABR's Collegiate Baseball committee.

Salary data was first supplied by Doug Pappas, who passed away during the summer of 2004. He was the leading authority on many subjects, 
most significantly the financial history of Major League Baseball.  We are grateful that he allowed us to include some of the data he 
compiled.  His work has been continued by the SABR Business of Baseball committee.  

Thanks are also due to the staff at the National Baseball Library in Cooperstown, who have been so helpful over the years, including
Tim Wiles, Jim Gates, Bruce Markusen, and the rest of the staff.  

A special debt of gratitude is owed to Dave Smith and the folks at Retrosheet. There is no other group working so hard to compile and
share baseball data.  Their website (www.Retrosheet.org) will give you a taste of the wealth of information Dave and the gang have 
collected.

Starting in 2023, the Lahman Database is updated and generated by Bryan Walko, who learned how to use databases from this very same
Lahman Database back in the late 1990s.

The HallOfFame data has been expanded with the permission of Graham Womack and his fantastic research into Known Veterans and 
Era Committee candidates, 1953-current, with some additional data researched and deduced by Bryan Walko. This provides us valuable
insight into not just the people who were voted in by these committees, but also what we know about those who were considered
over time.

Thank you, Sean, for donating the database to SABR, for overseeing the database for three decades, and for providing our first steps
into research during the Internet era.

Thanks to all contributors great and small. What you have created is a wonderful thing.

1.4 Using this Database

This version of the database is available in Microsoft Access format, SQL files, or in a generic, comma-delimited format. Because this 
is a relational database; you will not be able to use the data in a flat-database application. 

Please note that this is not a stand alone application.  It requires a database application or some other application designed specifically
to interact with the database.

If you are unable to import the data directly, you should download the database in the delimited text format.  Then use the documentation
in section 2.0 of this document, to import the data into your database application.

2.0 Data Tables

The design follows these general principles.  Each player is assigned a unique number (playerID).  All of the information relating to that player
is tagged with his playerID.  The playerIDs are linked to names and birthdates in the People table.

  Batting                Batting statistics
  Pitching               Pitching statistics
  Fielding               Fielding statistics
  FieldingOF             Outfield position data for years where LF/CF/RF fielding data is available, until 1955
  FieldingOFsplit        LF/CF/RF game played splits for all years, including those where LF/CF/RF fielding data is not available

  Appearances            Details on the positions a player appeared during a season
  Managers               Managerial statistics

2.1 Notes on Negro League data

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Seamheads data for the Negro League is now in the database. The data here constitutes major league data as per SABR's recommendations from 
Feb 11, 2021 (https://sabr.org/latest/sabr-negro-leagues-task-force-issues-recommendations-on-major-league-status/) and Jun 3, 2024
(https://sabr.org/latest/sabr-special-committee-acknowledges-1949-50-negro-american-league-independent-black-baseball-teams-as-major-league-caliber/).

The recovery of this data is an ongoing process, and changes can and will occur when new sources are located and compiled. The definitions of
the teams and games that qualify as major leagues may also differ across datasets (SABR, Seamheads, MLB, Retrosheet, Baseball Reference, etc.)
This database reflects SABR's current recommendations.

Playing level of data
All Negro League data within the Lahman database reflects major league caliber league and independent team competition. It does not include exhibitions
of any level (majors, minors, or semi-pro), nor does it include games within Cuban leagues. In all cases below, read any reference to data, stats, games,
teams, leagues, etc. within this context.

NULLs
Missing data within the Negro Leagues dataset will be represented by NULL values, rather than zeros, in the same way that existing National League
seasons in the 1800s may have NULL values for caught stealing. In both cases, the NULLs represent that the value is unknown. First names can also have
NULLs.

The 1939 Toledo Crawfords played in two leagues
Given the barnstorming nature of major league teams of Black baseball and the Negro Leagues, it is feasible that a single team may play within
more than a single league that qualifies as major league (or within a major league and barnstorming/independent games that qualify as major league) in a single 
year. 

Currently, there are no teams that played both major league games and barnstorming/independent games that qualify as major league in a single year. 

There is one team that played in more than one major league in a single year, the 1939 Toledo Crawfords, who played in the Negro American League and the second
Negro National League. Within this database, this is represented as two separate team IDs for 1939 (TC and TC2) that belong to one franchise (PC). This is a
unique situation within the database, and we believe it is the best way to present this data. However, it is atypical and therefore specially noted here.

On colleges
Seamheads has compiled a good list of colleges for people within the dataset. When reviewing this data, I discovered that many of the schools still existed
under different names. Many were already in the Lahman school list. I briefly considered keying the old data to the current schools, but I declined to do
that for the sake of keeping the history intact. I also did not want to change the table schema or have the name field of the college be a list of names.
I decided to take these old names of the schools and put them as new rows in the Schools table, but use the key for the current school with a year suffix
that corresponds to the first year that name was used. 

As a practical example, Howard Millon attended Illinois State Normal University. Today, this school is known as Illinois State University. It was called 
Illinois State Normal University from 1957-1964. In order to keep the identity of the school as it was when Millon attended, there will be a new school
record for Illinois State Normal University with a schoolID of illinoisst1857, which will tie it to Illinois State University, which has a schoolID of illinoisst. 
I have also taken a school like New Orleans University, which exists today as Dillard University, and given it the key of dillard1869. 

The Negro League college data lacks years, so the years in here will be NULL.

Team and Player level data
Due to the incomplete nature of Negro League data, there may be instances where game-level data is available but player-level data is not available. This can result
in player-level data not adding up to team level data.

Team record against all teams versus team record within league
Teams within leagues also played games outside of league competition against independent major league caliber Negro League teams. Because of this most Seamheads
team records will have wins, losses, and ties within the league and against all clubs. For the first iteration of Lahman, the records on the team table will reflect
the league level w/l/t data. For independent teams that lacked a league, the same data will reflect their record against all teams.

Player data against all teams versus within league
All player-level data is in the context of against all teams.

AllstarFull
There are six new "Leagues" within the data: NOS (North All Stars) and SAS (South All Stars) from the North-South series, WES (West All Stars) and EAS (East All Stars)
from the East-West series, and NNN (Negro National League II North All Stars) and NNS (Negro National League II South All Stars). Teams for the players will reflect the
primary team they were on that season (in terms of games played). There are cases where the only major league games that were played in that season were the All Star
Games, and in these cases I have looked back one season, then forward one season, then back two seasons, etc. until I located a team. There are two players in the
data who only played on the All Star team during their known major league career. S. M. Humphries in 1937 (who played on the independent non-major league Atlanta
Black Crackers) and Peppy Collins in 1939 (who has no other major league playing record). GameNum and gameID will be NULL, as we have the cumulative data for the year
not individual games within this dataset. With this, the startingPos field can have multiple positions, in a format like 3;6, if the player started one game at 1B and
another game at SS. The order of the data does not indicate the first or second game of a multiple-game record.

Appearances
GS will be NULL for many seasons. G_defense and g_of, both of which record distinct games on defense, not a simple sum of positional data. The dataset does not include
this level of granularity to tell when a player appeared at multiple positions during the same game.

FieldingOF
FieldingOF is not used as all the data is at the LF/CF/RF level.

Managers
Some teams do not have a known manager and these teams will not have a record within the Manager table.

ManagersHalf
There were several seasons with First and Second half champions for many Negro Leagues between 1925-1948. The exact records and standings are not within the 
dataset for each half. Therefore, the ManagersHalf table will not have any data for the Negro Leagues at this time.

SeriesPost and other Post tables
Round IDs are:
ALC (NAL Championship Series)
NWS (Negro League World Series)
NNC (NNL I Championship Series)
NLC (NNL II Championship Series)
NLP (NNL II Playoff Series)
NSC (NSL Championship Series)

TeamsHalf
There were several seasons with First and Second half champions for many Negro Leagues between 1925-1948. The exact records and standings are not within the 
dataset for each half. However, the TeamsHalf table has been updated with the known First and Second half champions, leaving the record blank with a Rank of 1.
Other teams outside the first place finish are not recorded in the table.
